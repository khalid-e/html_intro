    In the horn where the sunrise first kisses the sea,
    Lies Somalia, bold, where the winds wander free.
    A cradle of camels, of myrrh-scented air,
    Of poets and nomads with stories to share.
    
    Your coasts stretch like arms to the deep ocean's swell,
    Where dhow sails whisper the secrets they tell.
    The fish leap like verses, the coral reefs gleam,
    As if Allah Himself painted each dream.
    
    Mogadishu, proud, though battered by time,
    Still pulses with rhythm, with courage, with rhyme.
    Her minarets rise like a prayer in the dust,
    An echo of empires, of promise, of trust.
    
    The drums of the desert, the songs of the rain,
    The tales of the elders in each village lane—
    They speak of a people as fierce as the sun,
    Unbroken in spirit, together as one.
    
    Land of the frankincense, acacia trees wide,
    Where clan ties run deeper than even the tide.
    From Kismayo's calm shores to Hargeisa’s high lands,
    A country that heals with its own calloused hands.
    
    Oh Somalia, daughter of sand and of flame,
    Though the world may forget, you remember your name.
    And out of the silence, you rise with a cry—
    Not broken, but born again, under God’s sky.</pre>
